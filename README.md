This project is an introduction to the basic tools and techniques of machine learning, including models for both supervised and unsupervised learning, related optimization techniques, and methods for model validation. 
Projects include sample work on how to perform linear and logistic regressions, SVM classification and regression, kernels, regularization, clustering, and on-line algorithms for regret minimization.
